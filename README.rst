Instalation
===========

With Package Control
--------------------

If you have the `Package Control <http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control>`_ package installed, you can install OpenErp Snippets from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package", then search for OpenErp Snippets.

It's just that simple!

Without Package Control
-----------------------

If you haven't got Package Control installed (seriously, go install it!) you will need to make a clone of this repository into your packages folder.
