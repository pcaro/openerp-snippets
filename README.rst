OpenErp Snippets
================


This is a `sublime <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`_ package which includes a bunch of handy snippets for doing OpenERp development.

Snippets borrowed from `open-erp-eclipse-template <http://code.google.com/p/openerp-eclipse-template/>`_.

Instalation
===========

With Package Control
--------------------

If you have the `Package Control <http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control>`_ package installed, you can install OpenErp Snippets from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package", then search for OpenErp Snippets.

It's just that simple!

Without Package Control
-----------------------

If you haven't got Package Control installed (seriously, go install it!) you will need to make a clone of this repository into your packages folder.

Then, create a package-metadata.json file::

    {"url": "https://bitbucket.org/pcaro/openerp-snippets",
    "version": "0.1",
    "description": "Code snippets for developing with OpenErp"}
